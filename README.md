# fairly_odd_runner

A 2d side scroller built using Flutter and Flame, where the player runs and attacks or jumps over obstacles, which in my case, angry mushrooms. There‚Äôs also a score system, so if you attack one mushroom, you get 100 points. However, if you jump over the mushroom, you get zero points for being a coward. If you‚Äôre unable to do either of the two on time, it‚Äôs game over.
